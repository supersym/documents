Abstract
========

This repository contains primarily (currently) literate CoffeeScript articles.

While I was/am learning CoffeeScript, literate programming, asynchronous processing, writing web servers, routers and what not, I kept finding myself in need to write up pieces for my own use. They make excellent material and in the meanwhile, contain both executable code as well as directly usable [GitHub Flavored Markdown][01] sections.

This will be the upmarch to code libraries based around the idea of interactive learning, natural language processing, e-learning, publishing (e-books) and syntactic programming language features like highlighting but also GUI components such as inline code editor are needed to be understood before mastering this art.

I am heavily inspired by this magnificent pieces of work:
